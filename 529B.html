        <tr><td><p style="line-height: 1.5;">As rates of chronic illness rise, so does the need for personal and professional caretakers. With the overwhelming demand, there is a lack of caretakers to meet the demand. Due to this many compromises must be made when it comes to taking care of people with illness. With a lack of overseeing on many patients, particularly those who are older and have memory associated ailments, there is chance for a potential overdose, or forgetting to take the medication all together. The automatic pill dispenser allows autonomy for the patient who needs to take their medication on a schedule. By notifying patients through a noise, that it is time to take their medicine and preventing the patient from taking their medicine at the wrong time, this ensures that the patient can autonomously take their medicine while still being safe. Through the website the moderator can create a medication schedule for their automatic pill dispenser. </p>
          <br>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> Prior to choosing the automatic pill dispenser, the main innovation ideas that were considered as the project were an remote controlled delivery car, the temperature and humidity monitoring system, the home security system, and the exam training program along with the automatic pill dispenser. To select the top innovation a weighted evaluation matrix was used where the technical, societal, and financial needs were evaluated and compared for each product with purpose of seeing which idea would produce a viable product that could yield a profit.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The Minimum Viable Product for the automatic pill dispenser is an automatic pill dispenser which can only function with one type of pill. It will only allow users to take their medication at a specific point in time and release the medication one at a time after the user presses the button on the product. There will be a website that interfaces with the dispenser via Bluetooth. The website is where the moderators of the device will be able to modify the schedule for the medication. If the user does not take their medication during the allotted time period in the schedule a SMS message will be sent to the moderator. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">The overall goal of the project is to create a product that meets the specific needs of our intended customer. Through testing and evaluation, the group will gain many perspectives by doing both in team and outsourced testing. The result will be a user-friendly product that will deliver on the scope of the project. </p></td></tr>
